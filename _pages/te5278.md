## Course Description
This course studies error analysis and the Taylor series, methods for finding the roots of equations in one variable, methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems, curve fitting including regression and interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, and initial value problems in ordinary differential equations. The algorithms for these methods will be studied and implemented in the programming languages that have been studied.
