System modelling and control is dedicated to advancing the understanding, design, and simulation of complex systems in science and engineering. The field develops innovative methods and technologies for analyzing and controlling dynamic systems by combining applied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Its goal is to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application by turning research insights into practical solutions.

Research activities in system modelling and control are
* **System Modelling**: Create accurate mathematical representations of physical, biological, and engineering systems to understand their behavior and predict responses under various conditions.

* **Control Design**: Develop advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), intelligent control (including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and reinforcement learning), robust control, and adaptive control to optimize system performance.

* **Simulation**: Design and implement computational experiments to test and validate control strategies, evaluate system robustness, and simulate real-world scenarios.

Our research applications span multiple domains, including:

* Robotics and autonomous systems
* Renewable energy systems and smart grids
* Aerospace and UAVs
* Manufacturing systems and process control
* Biological and environmental systems

Feel free to explore our projects, publications, and activities as we strive to advance knowledge in system modelling, intelligent control, and simulation!
