He was born in Lamongan, East Java, Indonesia, and completed his elementary and middle school education there. After that, he continued his higher education at the <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/matematika/en/home/'>Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/'>Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)</a> in Surabaya, Indonesia and received Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees in Applied Mathematics in 2015, 2018, and 2024, respectively. In August-September 2014 and March-June 2015, he conducted an internship program at the Avionics at Aerospace Technology Center, <a href='https://dirgantara-lapan.or.id/'> National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN)</a>, Bogor, Indonesia. Since February 2022, he has been part of the <a href='https://elektro.unisla.ac.id/'>Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href='https://unisla.ac.id/'>Universitas Islam Lamongan (UNISLA)</a> in Lamongan, Indonesia. The department was initially part of the Faculty of Engineering, which has since been reorganized as the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST).

His research aims to contribute to the development of control strategies and algorithms that strike a balance between performance, robustness, and computational efficiency. These are his breakdown research interests:
* **State and disturbance estimation**: to use observers and filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of control actions.

* **Optimization-based control**: to obtain an optimal control strategy for constrained systems.

* **System identification**: to build mathematical models from data, especially for linear and nonlinear systems.
  
* **Stochastic and robust control**: to deal with uncertainties in real-world applications

His research applications span multiple domains, including:

* Robotics and autonomous systems
* Renewable energy systems and smart grids
* Aerospace and UAVs
* Manufacturing systems and process control
* Biological and environmental systems

Through this personal website, you can explore his projects, publications, and activities to advance knowledge in system modelling, intelligent control, and simulation. For more about him, please take a look at his [CV](assets/pdf/heripurnawan_CV.pdf).
