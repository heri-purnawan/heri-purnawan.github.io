Our group focuses on advancing the fields of system modelling, control design, and simulation to address complex challenges in science and engineering. By leveraging the power of applied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering, we aim to develop innovative methodologies and technologies that contribute to understanding and controlling dynamic systems.

I earned my Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees in Applied Mathematics from the <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/matematika/en/home/'>Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/'>Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)</a> in Surabaya, Indonesia, in 2015, 2018, and 2024, respectively. In August-September 2014 and March-June 2015, I conducted an internship program at the Avionics at Aerospace Technology Center, Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN), Bogor, Indonesia. Since February 2022, I have been part of the <a href='https://elektro.unisla.ac.id/'>Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at Universitas Islam Lamongan (UNISLA) in Lamongan, Indonesia. The department was initially under the Faculty of Engineering, which has since become the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST). My research interests are systems and control, including estimation, optimization, system identification, and model predictive control. For more about me, please take a look at my [CV](assets/pdf/heripurnawan_CV.pdf).
