I received my Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees in Applied Mathematics from the <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/matematika/en/home/'>Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href='https://www.its.ac.id/'>Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)</a> in Surabaya, Indonesia, in 2015, 2018, and 2024, respectively. In August-September 2014 and March-June 2015, I conducted an internship program at the Avionics at Aerospace Technology Center, <a href='https://dirgantara-lapan.or.id/'>Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN)</a>, Bogor, Indonesia. Since February 2022, I have been part of the <a href='https://elektro.unisla.ac.id/'>Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href='https://unisla.ac.id/'>Universitas Islam Lamongan (UNISLA)</a> in Lamongan, Indonesia. The department was initially under the Faculty of Engineering, which has since become the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST).

My research aims to contribute to developing control strategies and algorithms that balance performance, robustness, and computational efficiency. These are my breakdown research interests:
* **State and disturbance estimation**: to use observers and filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of control actions.

* **Optimization-based control**: to obtain an optimal control strategy for constrained systems.

* **System identification**: to build mathematical models from data, especially for linear and nonlinear systems.
  
* **Stochastic and robust control**: to deal with uncertainties in real-world applications

My research applications span multiple domains, including:

* Robotics and autonomous systems
* Renewable energy systems and smart grids
* Aerospace and UAVs
* Manufacturing systems and process control
* Biological and environmental systems

Through this personal website, feel free to explore my projects, publications, and activities to advance knowledge in system modelling, intelligent control, and simulation!
