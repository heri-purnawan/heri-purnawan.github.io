Welcome to the **System Modelling and Control Research Group**!

We bring together experts from applied mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, and statistics to foster a multidisciplinary environment for impactful research. By integrating theoretical insights with practical applications, we aim to bridge the gap between research and real-world implementation.

<h3>Research Activities</h3>

* **System Modelling**: Create accurate mathematical representations of physical, biological, and engineering systems to understand their behavior and predict responses under various conditions.

* **Control Design**: Develop advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), intelligent control (including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and reinforcement learning), robust control, and adaptive control to optimize system performance.

* **Simulation**: Design and implement computational experiments to test and validate control strategies, evaluate system robustness, and simulate real-world scenarios.

<h3>Applications</h3>
Our research spans multiple domains, including:

* Robotics and autonomous systems
* Renewable energy systems and smart grids
* Aerospace and UAVs
* Manufacturing systems and process control
* Biological and environmental systems

Feel free to explore our projects, publications, and activities as we strive to advance knowledge in system modelling, intelligent control, and simulation!
