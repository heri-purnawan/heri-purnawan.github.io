System Modelling and Control (SMC) Research Group is dedicated to advancing the understanding, design, and simulation of complex systems in science and engineering. The field develops innovative methods and technologies for analyzing and controlling dynamic systems by combining applied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Its goal is to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application by turning research insights into practical solutions.

Research activities in the SMC research group are

* **System Modelling**: Create accurate mathematical representations of physical, biological, and engineering systems to understand their behavior and predict responses under various conditions.

* **Control Design**: Develop advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), intelligent control (including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and reinforcement learning), robust control, and adaptive control to optimize system performance.

* **Simulation**: Design and implement computational experiments to test and validate control strategies, evaluate system robustness, and simulate real-world scenarios.

We’re seeking passionate students interested in system modelling and control design to collaborate on our scientific research and projects.

<h3>Your Profiles</h3>

* Have a strong desire to learn new knowledge.
* Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, systems and control theory, and optimization is desirable. However, you will learn and discuss this with us.
* Excellent programming skills: Python or MATLAB will be beneficial. Do not worry, though, since you will learn them with us.
* Good communication skills are essential, particularly in English. However, we can provide funding to support your learning if you want to take an English course.

If you are interested in becoming a part of our research group, please send your motivation letter to me by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="email">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a>. In your motivation letter, include an introduction about yourself, explain why you are interested in this research, and why you believe you would be an excellent candidate for our team.
