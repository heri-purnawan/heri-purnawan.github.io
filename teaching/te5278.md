## Course Description
This course explores critical topics in numerical methods, including error analysis, the Taylor series, root-finding techniques for equations in one variable, and methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems. It also covers curve fitting (regression and interpolation), numerical differentiation and integration, and solving initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. Students will study the underlying algorithms for these methods and implement them using relevant programming languages.
